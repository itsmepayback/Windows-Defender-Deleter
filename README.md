# Windows-Defender-Deleter
This program written in C++ and pascal will install itself as a service and then disable and delete windows defender every reboot. For now, you do not need to turn off any defender protection setting for it to work. This program is also currently in development, so feel free to report any issues that occurred.
Fixes:


Added A Shutdown Warning Before Restarting The computer.
Fixed Compatibility (Can Now Execute On Windows XP And Higher).
Added A Message Box At The End Saying Wheter The Removal Operation Completed Or Not.

To Do:
Re-Enable User Account Control After the Removal Process.
Add An Optional Automatic Uninstalling Process.
Probably More Fixes That Are Not In My Head Right Now.
