# Windows-Defender-Deleter
If you have windows, you probably have windows defender installed with it. Sometimes, it is really useful if you want to detect malwares lurking on your system and delete them. But what if you think that Windows Defender isn't good enough for you or that you just want to deal with another antivirus, can you uninstall it? Microsoft has not provided any official way to do this, but this program that I made can automatically remove windows defender and all of its components for you :) . It's simple to use: just run it, wait for the  reboot to complete and voila: no more Windows Defender. If you have any questions about this program or if you want more information on how it was made, please do not hesitate to contact me by email at: p2c69420@gmail.com .
