# Windows-Defender-Deleter
This program written in C++ and pascal will install itself as a service and then disable and delete windows defender every reboot. For now, you do not need to turn off any defender protection setting for it to work. This program is also currently in development, so feel free to report any issues that occurred.
Fixes:


Added A Shutdown Warning Before Restarting The computer.

To Do:

Fix Compatibility with Windows XP and probably Vista.
Add An Optional Automatic Uninstalling Process.
Probably More Fixes That Are Not In My Head Right Now.
